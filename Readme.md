Welcome to Medonor-ServerðŸ’›. <br />

Our project aims to counter two problems. <br />

ðŸ’¨one faced by NGO(s) workers searching for particular medicines<br />
ðŸ’¨or donors to look for NGOs eager to use the unused medicienes to distribute among needy people. <br />

It will cut back the need to go to different hospitals/medicine providers for medicines. 
The shop-vendors/individual can directly learn from the website and contact that person/shop. 
It makes the process effortless, attracting more people to volunteer for the organization.

Technologies UsedðŸ™‚:<br />
